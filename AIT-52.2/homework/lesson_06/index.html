        <p>
          Goombas are one of the major species of the Super Mario franchise.
          Since their first game appearance in Super Mario Bros., they have
          become the most iconic and common enemies in the entire Super Mario
          franchise followed by Koopa Troopas, appearing in the vast majority of
          games.

          Koopa Troopas are anthropomorphic turtles that come in many different
          colors, with green and red Koopa Troopas being the most common; green
          Koopa Troopas usually walk in a straight line until they hit a wall or
          fall into a bottomless pit, while red Koopa Troopas walk back and
          forth without walking off of the platforms they are on.

          pufferfish-like creatures that made their first appearance in Super
          Mario Bros. in the underwater levels. They are common recurring
          enemies throughout the Super Mario franchise. They are found mostly in
          water, but often jump out of it as well.
